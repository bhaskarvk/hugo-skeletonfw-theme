Responsive theme for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) based on [skeleton-framework](https://skeleton-framework.github.io/) suitable for blogs.

This started as a fork of [hugo-theme-skeleton](https://github.com/jblawatt/hugo-theme-skeleton) but deviated so quickly that I no longer see the need to keep this repo as a fork of the original.

This theme provides

- Table of Contents
- Tags/Series
- Social Media Buttons
- Responsive design
- Support for various typography fonts.

### TODO

- Documentation
